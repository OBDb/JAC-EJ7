    description: "The JAC EJ7 is an all-electric mid-size sedan developed by Chinese automaker JAC Motors. Featuring sleek, contemporary styling with clean lines, a fastback profile, and LED lighting elements, it represents JAC's most sophisticated electric vehicle design to date. The exterior incorporates aerodynamic elements including flush door handles, a smooth underbody, and optimized airflow management, contributing to its efficiency. Powered by a permanent magnet synchronous electric motor producing approximately 190 HP (142 kW) and 340 Nm of torque, it delivers a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of around 7.5 seconds. The lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of approximately 70 kWh enables a claimed range of up to 500 km under China's NEDC testing standard (approximately 400 km in real-world conditions). DC fast charging allows for a 30-80% charge in about 30 minutes. The interior features a minimalist, technology-focused design with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a large central touchscreen (approximately 12.8 inches), and touch-sensitive controls replacing many physical buttons. Advanced driver assistance systems include adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking. Positioned as JAC's premium electric offering, the EJ7 competes with domestic Chinese electric sedans like the BYD Han and Xpeng P7, as well as international models such as the Tesla Model 3, though it is primarily focused on the Chinese market with limited export availability. The EJ7 represents JAC's efforts to move upmarket and establish itself in the increasingly competitive Chinese electric vehicle segment, leveraging the company's experience as one of China's earlier entrants into the EV space."
